### 🚀 What I like to work on

- 🔹 **App development** — helping everyday life through tech  
- 🔹 **Systems / parallel programming** — thread synchronization, ring buffers, firewalls, performance-oriented C projects  
- 🔹 **Low-level & high-performance code** — understanding hardware constraints, memory, and optimization  
- 🔹 **Quant & finance-related tooling** — experimenting with data, signals, and strategies  

> I care about **readability, performance, and clear documentation** more than just “making it run”.
